## Usage

1. Start typing `var(` in any supported file
2. The extension will automatically show completions for all CSS variables defined in your workspace
3. Select a variable to insert it
4. Hover over a variable to see its value, documentation, and source location

Example completion:

```css
.example {
  /* Start typing var( here */
  color: var( /* Completions will appear */
}
```

## Supported File Types

- CSS (`.css`)
- SCSS (`.scss`)

- HTML (`.html`)
- React (`.jsx`, `.tsx`)
- Astro (`.astro`)

## Variable Detection

The extension detects CSS variables defined in the following format:

```css
--variable-name: value; /* Optional comment */
```

It automatically indexes:

- Variable name
- Value
- Inline comments
- Source file and line number

## Features in Detail

### Smart Completions

- Shows variable name and value in the completion list
- Differentiates between color and other variables
- Provides inline preview for color values

### Documentation View

When you highlight a completion, you'll see:

```css
--variable-name         value
```

Along with:

- Any associated comments
- Source file location (`filename:line`)

### Real-time Updates

- Automatically detects changes to CSS files
- Updates completions when variables are added, modified, or removed
- Debounced updates to prevent performance issues

## Installation

1. Open VS Code
2. Go to Extensions (Ctrl+Shift+X / Cmd+Shift+X)
3. Search for "CSVars"
4. Click Install

## Configuration

Currently, the extension works out of the box with no configuration needed. It automatically scans all CSS, SCSS, and LESS files in your workspace for variables.
